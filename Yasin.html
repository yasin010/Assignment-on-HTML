<center><h1>My Memorable Day</h1></center>
            

It will be a little hard for me to pick one day from my school life as the most memorable as almost every day from those 19 years is something I treasure.
If I were to pick one, I would say it is the day when I was selected as the school prefect.
To be honest it was a bolt in the blue and a little unsettling, yet an incredible feeling.
I always thought there are others more deserving than me.
I was a shy teen.Though not very good with words, but good grades and active extracurricular participation probably worked in my favour.
I also use to partake in sports like Cricket, Football and Badminton.
My fine performances even got me a chance in the school team.
I guess donning the school jersey made me a little popular among teachers and the other students.
